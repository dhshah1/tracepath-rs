# tracepath-rs

A non-root version of traceroute written in Rust for Linux.

## How to run it

```sh
$ git pull ...
$ cargo run google.com
...
```

## Notes

- I made this as a learning exercise, read about other things I learned here: https://petermalmgren.com/rust-tracepath/
- This program only works on Linux
- There are a bunch of features missing to make this a complete tracepath implementation
- PRs are welcome!
